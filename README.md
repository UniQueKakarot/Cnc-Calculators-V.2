# Cnc-Calculators-V.2
This is a project where I decided on redesigning my earlier project Cnc-Calculators. This time around I apply new perspective and use the kivy framework instead of Tkinter.

My goal is to make the application appear more "fresh", since the tkinter framework might look a little old-ish compared to the latest in UI's. And I'm aiming to add more functionality and implement some metrics into it this time.

If you happend to stumble upon this and have some constructive critisism or feedback, just open a issue with whatever tag suits you!
